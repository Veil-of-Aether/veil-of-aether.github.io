        <h1>About <i>The Veil of Aether</i></h1>
        <p>
          <i>The Veil of Aether</i> is a free and open-source (FOSS) action-adventure RPG.
            It is based in the fictional land of Neyvara, a world centered around the four elements of Earth, Fire, Wind, and Water.
            The protagonist of the game is Darian (the player), a young adult who sets out on an epic adventure to save the world from an evil sorcerer. 
            He must fight through trials and dungeons to reach the final climactic battle.
